A minimalist and elegant navbar component featuring a fluid, light-based ribbon aesthetic. Designed as part of Nora's Navbar Gallery, this experiment focuses on smooth morphing animations and subtle scroll interactions.

It demonstrates how Framer Motion's `layoutId` can create seamless transitions for active state indicators, giving the impression of a flowing, adaptive element.

## âœ¨ Key Features

* **Flowing Highlight:** Instead of a static underline, a gradient ribbon smoothly animates (`layoutId`, `type: 'spring'`) to position itself under the currently active navigation link.
* **Scroll Adaptation:** The navbar subtly changes its padding, background opacity, and blur intensity (`useScroll`, `useMotionValueEvent`, `animate`) as the user scrolls down the page, becoming less intrusive.
* **Glassmorphism Effect:** Uses Tailwind CSS (`backdrop-blur`, opacity) to create a semi-transparent, blurred background effect that adapts on scroll.
* **Clean & Minimalist:** Focuses on typography and the fluid motion of the highlight ribbon against a dark background.

## ðŸš€ Tech Stack

* **Core:** React.js
* **Animation:** Framer Motion (`layoutId`, `useScroll`, `useMotionValueEvent`)
